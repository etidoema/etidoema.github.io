A supply chain includes all the raw materials and parts that are made into a product and distributed up the chain for manufacture and sale.

In this project of mine I wont only categorize supply chain under the manufacturing zone, supply chain touches procurement, logistics and other corporate sectors. My focus will be more on the procurement zone. Procurement on its own is a critical component of supply chain management process. Procurement specifically refers to the process of acquiring goods & services.

That been said above, let's head right into our supply chain analytics projects.


The Supply Chain begins with the producers of raw materials and ends with the product being delivered to the consumer. In this project we will be more of the consumer side. so lets dive in to one of the terms that will help us in the supply chain ecosystem.

What is make vs buys
“Make versus buy” is a strategic decision-making process that organizations go through when determining whether to produce (make) a product or component in-house or to purchase (buy) it from external suppliers. This decision has significant implications for cost, quality, time-to-market, and resource allocation.

The Problem Statement

You are a Data analyst in a company that is into production of generators, spare parts and servicing. Your task is to create analyses that help the company determine make vs buy decision for many of their products they use in servicing their generators. The management has already requested quotes from the suppliers. Lets look at the data that we will be using for this analysis.
